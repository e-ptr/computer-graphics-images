palette:
	
	This progam maps an image to a color palette. The palette can be provided by the user or generated by the program
	
	1) run the "make" command
	2) run "./palette in.ext <palette.ext>"
		<> indicates optional arg
		palette.ext can either be an image file or a text file. Be aware that large image files will take a long time to be processed into a palette, this function is mainly intended for premade palettes stored as images. Text file palettes should be a list of hex codes, with one on each line.
	3) follow the command line instructions. descriptions of each command are below.
		s - simple color map.
		g - generate a color map. Console will prompt for a palette size, this must be a power of 2. This can take several minutes, even for small images and palettes.
		r - reset. Refreshes orignal image, with no color mapping
		c - change between user-provided palette and generated palette
		w - write image to a file. Console will prompt for filename, the filename must include an extension.
		d - Floyd-Steinberg dithering. THIS DOES NOT WORK AS INTENDED, but can lead to some interesting results so I've elected to leave it as part of the program.
	4) once done viewing the new image press q to close the window.
		
	Additional notes:
		A few sample images are provided, as well as palette.png and palette.txt. Both of these files are a basic 8 color palette that can be used for color mapping. There is also a scenepalette.txt which is a 16 color palette intended to be used with the scene.png image.
	
	Issues:
		Dithering does not function as intended.
		Palette generation takes several minutes, even for small images and palettes. My example image was roughly 600 by 600 and generating a 8 color palette for it took almost 8 minutes. This is mostly due to the sorting algorithm (selection sort) used within the median cut algorithm. A faster sorting algorithm would likely cut down the time immensely, but the median cut algorithm on its own is still a length process.
