tonemap:
	
	This progam provides some basic ways to process and display HDR images
	
	1) run the "make" command
	2) run "./tonemap <filename>"
	3) use the following key functions to manipulate the image
		b - Apply baseline tone mapping.
		g - Apply gamme compression. This will ask if you would like to use a custom gamma value or if you would like to use the computers default gamma. Gamma values should be floats between 0 and 1
		w - Write currently displayed image to a file. This will ask for a file name, please provide a valid file name WITHOUT AN EXTENSION.
		r - Reset the image to its original state.
		t - Toggle between displaying the edited image and the original.
		q - Quit.
		
	Issues:
		ocean.exr segfaults when the program tries to display it, i believe this is because the image is too large and my renderImage() function tries to create an array of 4.4B float values.
		The user input gamma value does not have any validation, values beyond 0 to 1 and non-float values can be input.
